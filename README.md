Shoot ya Friend

by Joseph LoManto

A simple 2 player 3ds homebrew game.

Controls:
- Up/Down - move left player
- L trigger - left player shoot
- X/B - move right player
- R trigger - right player shoot

Projectiles cannot pass through either barrier.
Barriers move independently.
Shoot at each other until someone's health hit zero (shown on bottom screen).
